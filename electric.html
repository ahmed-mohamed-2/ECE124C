  <p>An electric car is an automobile that is propelled by one or more electric motors, using energy stored 
in <span>rechargeable batteries.</span> The first practical electric cars were produced in the 1880s.

<p>Electric cars were popular in the late <span>19th century and early 20th </span>century, until advances in internal combustion
 engines, electric starters in particular, and mass production of cheaper petrol (gasoline) and diesel vehicles

  <h2>car definition </h2>
<p>A car is a <span>road vehicle</span> used to carry passengers (people). Cars usually have four wheels 
(round things which turn in order to lead to movement), and an engine or motor to make them move. 
Many cars were made during the</span> 20th century<span>. </p>
<h2>cars history</h2>
<p>
<img src="his.png" >
The earliest recorded automobiles were actually steam engines attached to wagons in
 <span>the late 18th century</span>.The steam engines were heavy, making these wagons slow and hard
 to control. Better and faster steam cars became common late in the 19th century.
<br><br>
</p>
<p>The internal combustion engine changed the way many automobiles were powered.
 The engine used either gasoline, diesel, or kerosene to work. 
</p>
<br>
<p>Although many people tried to make a good car that would work and sell well, 
people say that <span>Karl Benz</span> invented the modern automobile. He used a four-stroke type
 of internal combustion engine to power his <span>Benz Patent-Motorwagen </span>in 1886. He began 
to make many cars in a factory and sell them in Germany in 1888.

<h2>first car</h2>
<p>
<img src="ford.png" >
Benz may have invented the first modern car, and the Duryeas the first car to be 
sold, but<span> Henry Ford</span> sold the most cars to the most people. In 1910 he began making 
and selling his Model T, which was a huge success. 
</p>
<br>
<p>Many people could afford this car, not just the rich, because Ford used mass production. 
This meant he made many Model Ts in a short time in a factory. People say that the Model T is the
 car that<span> "put America on wheels"</span>. The Model T was the most popular car of the time because it was
 cheap but it was still a good quality car that ordinary people could own.

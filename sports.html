  <h2>sports cars</h2>
  <p>A sports car is designed to emphasise handling,<span>performance</span>, or thrill of driving. Sports cars originated in Europe
 in the early 1900s and are currently produced by many manufacturers around the world.
</p>
<img src="images/maz.png" >
<br><p>Definitions of sports cars often relate to how the car design is optimised for dynamic performance
without any specific minimum requirements; both a Triumph Spitfire and<span> Ferrari 488 Pista </span>can be considered sports cars, 
despite vastly different levels of performance. Broader definitions of sports cars include cars "in which performance takes
 precedence over carrying capacity
</p> <br>
<p>There is no fixed distinction between sports cars and other categories of performance cars, such as<span> muscle</span> cars and 
grand tourers, with some cars being members of several categories.

Traditionally, the most common layout for sports cars was a<span> roadster</span> (a two-seat car without a fixed roof),
however there are also several examples of early sports cars with four seats
</p>
<p>Sports cars are not usually intended to regularly transport more than two adult occupants, so most modern sports cars 
are usually<span> two-seat layout or 2+2 layout </span>
</p>
<br>
<p>the location of the engine and driven wheels significantly influence the handling characteristics of a car and 
are therefore important in the design of a sports car
traditionally, most sports cars have<span> used rear-wheel drive </span>with the engine either located at the front of the car (FR layout) or 
in the middle of the car (MR layout). Examples of FR layout sports cars are the Caterham 7, Mazda MX-5, and the Chevrolet Corvette
